# Multifeature-Linear-Regression-Model
My first Machine Learning Model. This linear regression is able to take a dataset consisting of multiple inputs and one output; And using that data, create a hypothesis or model to predict new outcomes with new inputs not found in the original training set

I did not use any machine learning frameworks because I wanted to challenge myself to create a Machine Learning model to scratch to prove that I understand the theoretical and mathematical reasonings of the model. 

Written in Python.
